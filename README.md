# Zip
This is an algorithm that takes any 5 digit number and determines whether or not it's a zip code. It was developed for my weather app, but the code grew to a point I consider this a separate project by now. Included is some files I used to generate the zip ranges. Note if you run the code it won't generate the arrays seen in the zip ranges files, there were some flaws I just addressed by using a linear search on about 1/3rd of the data and just copy-pasting it onto the resulting data (not shown). This explains why section 49's array is so massive compared to the others, that was mostly compiled using the linear search. Just want to shout out Luis Laugesen and his work on the two jsons with every single valid and invalid zip code (of which invalidZip.js and validZip.js are copy-pastes of). Saved me a ton of trouble, here's a link to the original files if you want to try something like this yourself: https://gist.github.com/lsl/98eb26082f71ce5d4f39eb348401b28b
